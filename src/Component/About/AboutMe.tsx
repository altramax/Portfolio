      <p>
        In, 2020 I became fascinated with the internet and decided to understand
        how websites work and that lead me to Html and css. Gradually my passion
        for the web grew and it lead me to Javascript, React and Typescript. I
        went on to build websites and web application that birthed the ideas of
        products owners.

        I take pleasure in writing codes that bring simple and user-frienly
        designs to life and I also enjoy spending time watching movies to relax.
